# VN30 Long-Only Machine Learning Framework

A research-grade framework for ranking VN30 stocks, forecasting forward relative returns versus the VN30 benchmark, and constructing constrained long-only portfolios under Vietnam-specific market frictions.

This project is a transparent research framework. It is not a live trading system and it is not financial advice.

## Project objective

The goal is to study whether daily public OHLCV-based features can support medium-frequency VN30 stock ranking and long-only portfolio construction.

The framework focuses on:

- Forward relative-return prediction versus the VN30 benchmark
- Walk-forward validation instead of random train-test splitting
- Long-only constrained portfolio construction
- Vietnam-specific transaction costs and price-limit frictions
- Feature ablation and forecast horizon robustness testing
- Final report artifacts for methodology, results, audit, tables, and figures

## Data

Main raw data source:

```text
data/raw/vnstock/vn30_ohlcv.csv
```

Current dataset:

- 46,863 daily OHLCV rows
- 30 VN30 tickers
- Date range: 2020-01-02 to 2026-06-30
- Daily end-of-day data, not intraday data

Important limitation:

The current VN30 universe is static, not fully point-in-time. This may introduce survivorship bias and should be addressed in future work.

## Framework components

The project includes:

- Feature engineering
- Forward relative-return labels
- Walk-forward validation
- Linear, tree-based, and classification models
- Baseline portfolios
- Rolling past-only risk model
- Constrained long-only optimizer
- Transaction-cost-aware backtester
- Price-limit-aware execution comparison
- Herding-aware portfolio risk control
- Feature ablation testing
- Forecast horizon testing
- Result visualization
- Final methodology, results, and audit reports

## Main research finding

The strongest tested forecast horizon is currently the 10-day forward relative-return label.

Forecast horizon results:

| Horizon | Average Rank IC | Top-5 Hit Rate | Diagnostic Sharpe | Max Active Drawdown | Final After-Cost Active Return |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1d | -0.003844 | 0.447861 | -0.140805 | -1.525574 | -1.508238 |
| 5d | 0.338033 | 0.676072 | 0.840073 | -0.355852 | 29.360326 |
| 10d | 0.546504 | 0.801122 | 1.398924 | -0.219472 | 77.915433 |

Interpretation:

- 1-day prediction is weak and noisy.
- 5-day prediction is a strong baseline.
- 10-day prediction is the strongest tested research horizon so far.

## Feature ablation summary

The full feature set performs best overall.

| Feature Set | Feature Count | Average Rank IC | Diagnostic Sharpe | Final After-Cost Active Return |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| all_features | 51 | 0.338033 | 0.840073 | 29.360326 |
| without_herding | 41 | 0.337983 | 0.827557 | 29.281588 |
| without_price_limit | 36 | 0.316762 | 0.784717 | 27.268516 |
| without_risk | 49 | 0.314453 | 0.749285 | 26.301430 |
| without_volume_liquidity | 40 | 0.307164 | 0.742006 | 26.341446 |

Interpretation:

- Volume/liquidity, price-limit, and risk features matter more for raw predictive performance.
- Herding features add limited standalone alpha.
- Herding remains useful as a portfolio-level risk-control mechanism.

## How to view outputs locally

Open reports in VS Code:

```powershell
code .\reports\final_results.md
code .\reports\methodology.md
code .\reports\final_audit.md
```

Preview Markdown in VS Code:

```text
Ctrl + Shift + V
```

Open figures:

```powershell
explorer .\reports\figures
```

Open tables:

```powershell
explorer .\reports\tables
```

## Repository hygiene

Generated data files are intentionally ignored by Git:

```text
data/processed/
data/raw/vnstock/
data/raw/yahoo/
```

These files are local reproducible outputs and should not be committed unless they are final report tables or figures.

## Project status and next upgrades

Completed usability upgrades:

- Updated the GitHub README as the project front page
- Added PROJECT_CONTEXT.md as the reusable project handoff prompt
- Added reports/report_index.md to link reports, tables, and figures
- Added scripts/report_summary.py for a quick command-line project summary
- Added scripts/run_full_pipeline.py for controlled one-command pipeline refresh
- Added .gitignore rules so generated raw and processed data stay local
- Removed the UTF-8 BOM from requirements.txt
- Made the data-quality report deterministic by removing runtime timestamp noise

Priority next upgrades:

- Keep PROJECT_CONTEXT.md updated after major project changes
- Add stale-output handling for old generated predictions
- Add a clean audit/update workflow after each rerun
- Add optional daily auto-update later through Windows Task Scheduler or GitHub Actions

Medium-term upgrades:

- Add Streamlit dashboard
- Add stronger out-of-sample robustness tests
- Add non-overlapping portfolio evaluation
- Improve execution realism

Long-term research upgrades:

- Add point-in-time VN30 membership
- Add fundamental data
- Add foreign ownership or flow data
- Add macro variables
- Add reproducible sentiment or news features if reliable sources are available
