# VN30 Alpha Research Framework

Ranks VN30 stocks by expected 1-, 5-, and 10-day outperformance, then tests whether those signals can support a constrained long-only portfolio.

The framework uses daily OHLCV data, walk-forward validation, transaction costs, portfolio constraints, and Vietnam-specific market frictions. It is a research project, not a live trading system or investment advice.

## Key result

After enforcing horizon-aware purged walk-forward gaps, the earlier strong 5d/10d headline metrics collapse toward near-zero diagnostic Sharpe and low Rank IC.

The current project should be read as a reproducible VN30 research framework and leakage-control case study, not evidence of a deployable alpha strategy. The 10-day horizon remains the best of the tested horizons, but the absolute signal strength is weak after purging.

## Method summary

The project includes:

- OHLCV feature engineering
- Forward relative-return labels versus VN30 benchmark
- Walk-forward model validation
- Linear, tree-based, gradient boosting, and classification models
- Forecast-horizon and feature-ablation tests
- Long-only portfolio optimization
- Transaction-cost-aware backtesting
- Price-limit-aware execution comparison
- Herding-aware portfolio risk control
- Static reports and interactive dashboard

## Key terms

- **Rank IC**: correlation between predicted stock ranking and realized future ranking.
- **Top-5 hit rate**: how often top-ranked stocks become strong realized performers.
- **Diagnostic Sharpe**: risk-adjusted comparison metric used inside this research framework.
- **Active return**: return relative to the benchmark or reference portfolio.
- **After-cost active return**: active return after estimated trading costs.
- **Max active drawdown**: largest fall from a previous active-return peak.
- **Walk-forward validation**: train on past data, test on later unseen dates.
- **Feature ablation**: remove feature groups to test whether they add value.

## Metric conventions

- Decimal values in result tables are often percent-like units. Example: `-0.219472` means about `-21.95%`.
- Rank IC and diagnostic Sharpe are unitless.
- Final after-cost active return is a historical backtest metric, not a live-return claim.

## Data

Main raw data source:

```text
data/raw/vnstock/vn30_ohlcv.csv
```

Current dataset:

- 46,863 daily OHLCV rows
- 30 VN30 tickers
- Date range: 2020-01-02 to 2026-06-30
- Daily end-of-day data, not intraday data

Important limitation:

The current VN30 universe is static, not fully point-in-time. This may introduce survivorship bias and should be addressed in future work.

## Main research finding

The post-purge results no longer support a strong alpha claim. The framework remains useful because it exposes how sensitive the earlier 5d/10d performance was to overlapping-label boundary leakage.

Forecast horizon results:

| Horizon | Average Rank IC | Top-5 Hit Rate | Average After-Cost Return / Period | Diagnostic Sharpe | Final Cumulative After-Cost Active Return | Evaluated Dates |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1d | 0.021733 | 0.463687 | -0.000310 | -0.046746 | -0.499% | 1611 |
| 5d | 0.018626 | 0.460913 | 0.000377 | 0.019013 | 0.603% | 1599 |
| 10d | 0.036949 | 0.476389 | 0.001830 | 0.066134 | 2.899% | 1584 |

Interpretation:

- 1-day prediction remains weak and noisy.
- 5-day and 10-day prediction no longer show strong diagnostic Sharpe after purging.
- The old headline 5d/10d results should be treated as leakage-inflated and superseded by the current purged results.

## Feature ablation summary

After purging, feature ablation differences are small and should be treated as diagnostics rather than stable feature-selection evidence.

| Feature Set | Feature Count | Average Rank IC | Top-5 Hit Rate | Diagnostic Sharpe | Final Cumulative After-Cost Active Return | Evaluated Dates |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Excluding volume/liquidity | 40 | 0.021964 | 0.473546 | 0.033764 | 1.065% | 1599 |
| All features | 51 | 0.018626 | 0.460913 | 0.019013 | 0.603% | 1599 |
| Excluding herding features | 41 | 0.017576 | 0.459287 | 0.018505 | 0.584% | 1599 |
| Excluding risk features | 49 | 0.018399 | 0.461288 | 0.015306 | 0.463% | 1599 |
| Excluding price-limit features | 36 | 0.011299 | 0.453158 | -0.011933 | -0.352% | 1599 |

Interpretation:

- The feature groups no longer show strong standalone alpha after purged evaluation.
- Feature ablation remains useful for auditing model sensitivity.
- Herding and concentration controls are still useful as portfolio-risk diagnostics, not proven alpha sources.

## Pipeline runner workflows

The main local runner is:

```powershell
py .\scripts\Run Full Pipeline.py
```

This runner refreshes outputs from existing local raw data only. It does not download or update live market data yet.

### Full local rebuild

Use this when you want to rebuild generated outputs from existing raw data:

```powershell
py .\scripts\Run Full Pipeline.py --clean-first --audit-after
```

### Faster local refresh

Use this when you want to preserve expensive ML prediction caches and reuse them only when they are still fresh:

```powershell
py .\scripts\Run Full Pipeline.py --clean-first --keep-expensive-ml --reuse-existing-ml --audit-after
```

Cache reuse is stale-aware. If features, labels, or relevant model source files change, the affected ML stages rerun automatically.

A cleaner dry run may report missing generated files. This is normal when optional or older generated outputs are listed by the cleaner but are not currently present locally.

## Repository hygiene

Generated data files are intentionally ignored by Git:

```text
data/processed/
data/raw/vnstock/
```

These files are local reproducible outputs and should not be committed unless they are final report tables or figures.

## Next upgrades

Priority next upgrades:

- Keep README and final audit notes updated after major project changes
- Add a clean audit/update workflow after each rerun
- Add optional daily auto-update later through Windows Task Scheduler or GitHub Actions
- Add a Streamlit dashboard for tables and figures

Medium-term upgrades:

- Add stronger out-of-sample robustness tests
- Add non-overlapping portfolio evaluation
- Improve execution realism
- Add HTML or Excel report export if needed

Long-term research upgrades:

- Add point-in-time VN30 membership
- Add fundamental data
- Add foreign ownership or flow data
- Add macro variables
- Add reproducible sentiment or news features if reliable sources are available

## Research validity limitations and next steps

This project is currently a research-grade backtesting framework, not a live trading system. The dashboard and reports should be read as historical diagnostics rather than investment recommendations.

Current methodological limitations:

- Static VN30 universe: the current dataset uses a fixed VN30 stock universe rather than point-in-time VN30 membership. This can create survivorship bias because today's constituents may not fully represent the investable VN30 universe at earlier dates.
- Multiple comparisons: the project tests multiple forecast horizons, feature ablations, optimizer variants, and execution assumptions on the same historical dataset. The best-looking result may partly reflect search across configurations rather than stable predictive skill.
- Point-estimate metrics: current Sharpe, Rank IC, drawdown, and return metrics are reported as point estimates. Future versions should add bootstrap confidence intervals or a deflated Sharpe ratio.
- Baseline comparison: future reports should display ML results directly against simple baselines such as equal-weight VN30 and a simple momentum-only rule.
- Corporate actions: before relying on automated daily updates, the project should further audit whether OHLCV prices are consistently adjusted for splits, stock dividends, and other HOSE corporate actions.
- Live-execution frictions: a future live or paper-trading workflow should consider VN-specific constraints such as foreign ownership room, liquidity, price limits, turnover, and realistic order execution.

## Current dashboard robustness diagnostics

The public dashboard now includes additional robustness diagnostics intended to make the backtest easier to audit and harder to overread:

- **Baseline comparison:** compares the ML strategy against equal-weight VN30-style exposure and simple rule-based baselines, including top-5 momentum, top-5 reversal, and low-volatility selection.
- **Cost-basis disclosure:** ML strategy rows use after-cost active return, while naive baseline rows are shown before transaction-cost adjustment.
- **Concentration risk:** surfaces latest max single-name weight, HHI, effective position count, and top issuer-group exposure.
- **Issuer-group exposure:** highlights cases where multiple tickers from the same issuer group create hidden concentration, such as VHM and VIC under Vingroup.
- **Latest rank diagnostic:** compares the latest predicted rank with realized forward-return rank so model hits and misses are visible.
- **Overlapping-window disclosure:** reports both raw evaluated dates and approximate non-overlapping effective sample size. For the 10-day horizon, the current output shows 1,584 evaluated dates, approximately 158 non-overlapping 10-day periods.
- **Purged walk-forward disclosure:** train, validation, and test windows now use purge gaps to reduce overlapping-label boundary leakage.

These diagnostics are still research checks. They do not turn the framework into live-trading evidence.
