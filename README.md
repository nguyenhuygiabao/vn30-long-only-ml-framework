# VN30 Alpha Research Framework

Ranks VN30 stocks by expected 1-, 5-, and 10-day outperformance, then tests whether those signals can support a constrained long-only portfolio.

The framework uses daily OHLCV data, walk-forward validation, transaction costs, portfolio constraints, and Vietnam-specific market frictions. It is a research project, not a live trading system or investment advice.

## Key result

**The 10-day horizon is the strongest tested setup so far.**

In the current historical backtest, the 10-day label has the best Rank IC, top-5 hit rate, diagnostic Sharpe, and final after-cost active return among the tested horizons.

Known limitations remain: the VN30 universe is static, results are point estimates, and multiple tested configurations create selection risk.

## Method summary

The project includes:

- OHLCV feature engineering
- Forward relative-return labels versus VN30 benchmark
- Walk-forward model validation
- Linear, tree-based, gradient boosting, and classification models
- Forecast-horizon and feature-ablation tests
- Long-only portfolio optimization
- Transaction-cost-aware backtesting
- Price-limit-aware execution comparison
- Herding-aware portfolio risk control
- Static reports and interactive dashboard

## Key terms

- **Rank IC**: correlation between predicted stock ranking and realized future ranking.
- **Top-5 hit rate**: how often top-ranked stocks become strong realized performers.
- **Diagnostic Sharpe**: risk-adjusted comparison metric used inside this research framework.
- **Active return**: return relative to the benchmark or reference portfolio.
- **After-cost active return**: active return after estimated trading costs.
- **Max active drawdown**: largest fall from a previous active-return peak.
- **Walk-forward validation**: train on past data, test on later unseen dates.
- **Feature ablation**: remove feature groups to test whether they add value.

## Metric conventions

- Decimal values in result tables are often percent-like units. Example: `-0.219472` means about `-21.95%`.
- Rank IC and diagnostic Sharpe are unitless.
- Final after-cost active return is a historical backtest metric, not a live-return claim.

## Data

Main raw data source:

```text
data/raw/vnstock/vn30_ohlcv.csv
```

Current dataset:

- 46,863 daily OHLCV rows
- 30 VN30 tickers
- Date range: 2020-01-02 to 2026-06-30
- Daily end-of-day data, not intraday data

Important limitation:

The current VN30 universe is static, not fully point-in-time. This may introduce survivorship bias and should be addressed in future work.

## Main research finding

The strongest tested forecast horizon is currently the 10-day forward relative-return label.

Forecast horizon results:

| Horizon | Average Rank IC | Top-5 Hit Rate | Diagnostic Sharpe | Max Active Drawdown | Final After-Cost Active Return |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1d | -0.003844 | 0.447861 | -0.140805 | -1.525574 | -1.508238 |
| 5d | 0.338033 | 0.676072 | 0.840073 | -0.355852 | 29.360326 |
| 10d | 0.546504 | 0.801122 | 1.398924 | -0.219472 | 77.915433 |

Interpretation:

- 1-day prediction is weak and noisy.
- 5-day prediction is a strong baseline.
- 10-day prediction is the strongest tested research horizon so far.

## Feature ablation summary

The full feature set performs best overall.

| Feature Set | Feature Count | Average Rank IC | Diagnostic Sharpe | Final After-Cost Active Return |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| all_features | 51 | 0.338033 | 0.840073 | 29.360326 |
| without_herding | 41 | 0.337983 | 0.827557 | 29.281588 |
| without_price_limit | 36 | 0.316762 | 0.784717 | 27.268516 |
| without_risk | 49 | 0.314453 | 0.749285 | 26.301430 |
| without_volume_liquidity | 40 | 0.307164 | 0.742006 | 26.341446 |

Interpretation:

- Volume/liquidity, price-limit, and risk features matter more for raw predictive performance.
- Herding features add limited standalone alpha.
- Herding remains useful as a portfolio-level risk-control mechanism.

## Pipeline runner workflows

The main local runner is:

```powershell
py .\scripts\run_full_pipeline.py
```

This runner refreshes outputs from existing local raw data only. It does not download or update live market data yet.

### Full local rebuild

Use this when you want to rebuild generated outputs from existing raw data:

```powershell
py .\scripts\run_full_pipeline.py --clean-first --audit-after
```

### Faster local refresh

Use this when you want to preserve expensive ML prediction caches and reuse them only when they are still fresh:

```powershell
py .\scripts\run_full_pipeline.py --clean-first --keep-expensive-ml --reuse-existing-ml --audit-after
```

Cache reuse is stale-aware. If features, labels, or relevant model source files change, the affected ML stages rerun automatically.

A cleaner dry run may report missing generated files. This is normal when optional or older generated outputs are listed by the cleaner but are not currently present locally.

## Repository hygiene

Generated data files are intentionally ignored by Git:

```text
data/processed/
data/raw/vnstock/
```

These files are local reproducible outputs and should not be committed unless they are final report tables or figures.

## Next upgrades

Priority next upgrades:

- Keep README and final audit notes updated after major project changes
- Add a clean audit/update workflow after each rerun
- Add optional daily auto-update later through Windows Task Scheduler or GitHub Actions
- Add a Streamlit dashboard for tables and figures

Medium-term upgrades:

- Add stronger out-of-sample robustness tests
- Add non-overlapping portfolio evaluation
- Improve execution realism
- Add HTML or Excel report export if needed

Long-term research upgrades:

- Add point-in-time VN30 membership
- Add fundamental data
- Add foreign ownership or flow data
- Add macro variables
- Add reproducible sentiment or news features if reliable sources are available

## Research validity limitations and next steps

This project is currently a research-grade backtesting framework, not a live trading system. The dashboard and reports should be read as historical diagnostics rather than investment recommendations.

Current methodological limitations:

- Static VN30 universe: the current dataset uses a fixed VN30 stock universe rather than point-in-time VN30 membership. This can create survivorship bias because today's constituents may not fully represent the investable VN30 universe at earlier dates.
- Multiple comparisons: the project tests multiple forecast horizons, feature ablations, optimizer variants, and execution assumptions on the same historical dataset. The best-looking result may partly reflect search across configurations rather than stable predictive skill.
- Point-estimate metrics: current Sharpe, Rank IC, drawdown, and return metrics are reported as point estimates. Future versions should add bootstrap confidence intervals or a deflated Sharpe ratio.
- Baseline comparison: future reports should display ML results directly against simple baselines such as equal-weight VN30 and a simple momentum-only rule.
- Corporate actions: before relying on automated daily updates, the project should further audit whether OHLCV prices are consistently adjusted for splits, stock dividends, and other HOSE corporate actions.
- Live-execution frictions: a future live or paper-trading workflow should consider VN-specific constraints such as foreign ownership room, liquidity, price limits, turnover, and realistic order execution.

## Current dashboard robustness diagnostics

The public dashboard now includes additional robustness diagnostics intended to make the backtest easier to audit and harder to overread:

- **Baseline comparison:** compares the ML strategy against equal-weight VN30-style exposure and simple rule-based baselines, including top-5 momentum, top-5 reversal, and low-volatility selection.
- **Cost-basis disclosure:** ML strategy rows use after-cost active return, while naive baseline rows are shown before transaction-cost adjustment. The dashboard labels this difference directly.
- **Concentration risk:** surfaces latest max single-name weight, HHI, effective position count, and top issuer-group exposure.
- **Issuer-group exposure:** highlights cases where multiple tickers from the same issuer group create hidden concentration, such as VHM and VIC under Vingroup.
- **Latest rank diagnostic:** compares the latest predicted rank with realized forward-return rank so model hits and misses are visible.
- **Overlapping-window disclosure:** reports both raw evaluated dates and approximate non-overlapping effective sample size. For the 10-day horizon, the current output shows 1,604 evaluated dates, approximately 160 non-overlapping 10-day periods.

These diagnostics are still research checks. They do not turn the framework into live-trading evidence.
