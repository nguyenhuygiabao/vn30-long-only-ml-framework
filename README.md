# VN30 Long-Only Machine Learning Framework

A research-grade framework for ranking VN30 stocks, forecasting forward relative returns versus the VN30 benchmark, and constructing constrained long-only portfolios under Vietnam-specific market frictions.

This project is a transparent research framework. It is not a live trading system and it is not financial advice.

## Project objective

The goal is to study whether daily public OHLCV-based features can support medium-frequency VN30 stock ranking and long-only portfolio construction.

The framework focuses on:

- Forward relative-return prediction versus the VN30 benchmark
- Walk-forward validation instead of random train-test splitting
- Long-only constrained portfolio construction
- Vietnam-specific transaction costs and price-limit frictions
- Feature ablation and forecast horizon robustness testing
- Final report artifacts for methodology, results, audit, tables, and figures

## Data

Main raw data source:

```text
data/raw/vnstock/vn30_ohlcv.csv
```

Current dataset:

- 46,863 daily OHLCV rows
- 30 VN30 tickers
- Date range: 2020-01-02 to 2026-06-30
- Daily end-of-day data, not intraday data

Important limitation:

The current VN30 universe is static, not fully point-in-time. This may introduce survivorship bias and should be addressed in future work.

## Framework components

The project includes:

- Feature engineering
- Forward relative-return labels
- Walk-forward validation
- Linear, tree-based, and classification models
- Baseline portfolios
- Rolling past-only risk model
- Constrained long-only optimizer
- Transaction-cost-aware backtester

- Herding-aware portfolio risk control
- Feature ablation testing
- Forecast horizon testing
- Result visualization
- Final methodology, results, and audit reports

## Main research finding

The strongest tested forecast horizon is currently the 10-day forward relative-return label.

Forecast horizon results:

| Horizon | Average Rank IC | Top-5 Hit Rate | Diagnostic Sharpe | Max Active Drawdown | Final After-Cost Active Return |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1d | -0.003844 | 0.447861 | -0.140805 | -1.525574 | -1.508238 |
| 5d | 0.338033 | 0.676072 | 0.840073 | -0.355852 | 29.360326 |
| 10d | 0.546504 | 0.801122 | 1.398924 | -0.219472 | 77.915433 |

Interpretation:

- 1-day prediction is weak and noisy.
- 5-day prediction is a strong baseline.
- 10-day prediction is the strongest tested research horizon so far.

## Feature ablation summary

The full feature set performs best overall.

| Feature Set | Feature Count | Average Rank IC | Diagnostic Sharpe | Final After-Cost Active Return |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| all_features | 51 | 0.338033 | 0.840073 | 29.360326 |
| without_herding | 41 | 0.337983 | 0.827557 | 29.281588 |
| without_price_limit | 36 | 0.316762 | 0.784717 | 27.268516 |
| without_risk | 49 | 0.314453 | 0.749285 | 26.301430 |
| without_volume_liquidity | 40 | 0.307164 | 0.742006 | 26.341446 |

Interpretation:

- Volume/liquidity, price-limit, and risk features matter more for raw predictive performance.
- Herding features add limited standalone alpha.
- Herding remains useful as a portfolio-level risk-control mechanism.

## How to view outputs locally

Open reports in VS Code:

```powershell
code .\reports\final_results.md
code .\reports\methodology.md
code .\reports\final_audit.md
```

Preview Markdown in VS Code:

```text
Ctrl + Shift + V

Open figures:

```powershell
explorer .\reports\figures
```

Open tables:

```powershell
explorer .\reports\tables
```

## Pipeline runner workflows

The main local runner is:

```powershell
py .\scripts\run_full_pipeline.py
```

This runner refreshes outputs from existing local raw data only. It does not download or update live market data yet.

### Full local rebuild

Use this when you want to rebuild generated outputs from existing raw data:

```powershell
py .\scripts\run_full_pipeline.py --clean-first --audit-after
```

### Faster local refresh

Use this when you want to preserve expensive ML prediction caches and reuse them only when they are still fresh:

```powershell
py .\scripts\run_full_pipeline.py --clean-first --keep-expensive-ml --reuse-existing-ml --audit-after
```

Cache reuse is stale-aware. If features, labels, or relevant model source files change, the affected ML stages rerun automatically.

A cleaner dry run may report missing generated files. This is normal when optional or older generated outputs are listed by the cleaner but are not currently present locally.

## Repository hygiene

Generated data files are intentionally ignored by Git:

```text
data/processed/
data/raw/vnstock/
data/raw/yahoo/
```

These files are local reproducible outputs and should not be committed unless they are final report tables or figures.

## Research validity limitations and next steps

This project is currently a research-grade backtesting framework, not a live trading system. The dashboard and reports should be read as historical diagnostics rather than investment recommendations.

Current methodological limitations:

- Static VN30 universe: the current dataset uses a fixed VN30 stock universe rather than point-in-time VN30 membership. This can create survivorship bias because today's constituents may not fully represent the investable VN30 universe at earlier dates.
- Multiple comparisons: the project tests multiple forecast horizons, feature ablations, optimizer variants, and execution assumptions on the same historical dataset. The best-looking result may partly reflect search across configurations rather than stable predictive skill.
- Point-estimate metrics: current Sharpe, Rank IC, drawdown, and return metrics are reported as point estimates. Future versions should add bootstrap confidence intervals or a deflated Sharpe ratio.
- Baseline comparison: future reports should display ML results directly against simple baselines such as equal-weight VN30 and a simple momentum-only rule.
- Corporate actions: before relying on automated daily updates, the project should further audit whether OHLCV prices are consistently adjusted for splits, stock dividends, and other HOSE corporate actions.
- Live-execution frictions: a future live or paper-trading workflow should consider VN-specific constraints such as foreign ownership room, liquidity, price limits, turnover, and realistic order execution.

Priority research upgrades before live trading claims:

1. Add explicit equal-weight and momentum-only baseline comparisons to the dashboard.
2. Add bootstrap confidence intervals or deflated Sharpe diagnostics.
3. Replace the static VN30 universe with point-in-time VN30 membership when reliable constituent history is available.
4. Audit corporate-action adjustment quality in the raw OHLCV source.
5. Add paper-trading validation before considering any live execution workflow.
